                            by step.  I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
                            did not disappoint . They were very hands-on  and I never had to wait long for assitance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took
                            my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to during interviews as an example of my developent
                            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!"</p>
